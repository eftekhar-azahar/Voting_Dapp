## Features
- Decentralized voting system
- Secure and transparent voting process
- Smart contract-based vote management
- User-friendly interface for creating and participating in votes
- Persistent data storage using TinyDB
- Web interface using Flask for interacting with voters

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voting-dapp.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd voting-dapp
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Deploy the smart contracts to your Ethereum network.
Interact with the smart contracts using a web3-enabled interface or through a custom frontend application.
Flask Integration
The Voting DApp includes a Flask web interface for managing user interactions with the deployed smart contracts.

Routes:
/ - Home page with the main voting interface.
/process_form - Handles the form submission for votes and verifies OTPs against TinyDB.
Deployment
Run the Flask app:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Database Integration
TinyDB is used for storing voter data securely.
Example code for inserting data into voter_data.json:
python
Copy code
from tinydb import TinyDB

db = TinyDB('voter_data.json')

db.insert({"name": "Ateek", "OTP": 345, "vote": 2})
